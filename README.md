# earthquake-recognition

I am researching using neural nets for earthquake detection.

Pretty messy right now, I'll clean up the Repo at the end of this internship.

### Neural Nets for earthquake recognition

1. Retrieving and processing the data:

2. Training the Data with Neural Nets (where I'm at now, for the next month)

### Other Stuff

##### Basic Data Processing:
